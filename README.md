# PhonePricePredictor - AI-Based Mobile Price Prediction

Welcome to the **PhonePricePredictor** project! This AI-based application predicts the price of a mobile phone based on various input features such as RAM, operating system, brand, screen size, and other specifications. The model uses machine learning techniques to provide an estimated price for the phone based on these features.

The project was deployed on **Skerlink**, a platform for hosting and running web applications.

## Features
- **Price Prediction**: Predicts the price of a mobile phone based on input features like RAM, brand, screen size, and operating system.
- **User Input**: Users can input various phone specifications such as RAM, processor type, screen size, and OS to get an estimated price.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of predicted prices based on the input data.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Skerlink, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Web Deployment**: Skerlink (for hosting the web application)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Languages**: Python, HTML (for basic web interface)

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository:  
    `git clone https://github.com/Dilara-selin/PhonePricePredictor.git`
2. Install the required libraries manually:
    - `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code:
    - Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
4. Provide phone specifications such as RAM, operating system, and screen size to get the predicted price.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The model is trained on a dataset containing various mobile phone specifications and their corresponding prices.
2. **Preprocessing**: Features such as RAM, operating system, brand, etc., are preprocessed before being input into the model.
3. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts the price of the mobile phone based on the userâ€™s provided specifications.
4. **Web Deployment**: The web application is hosted and accessible through **Skerlink** for easy access and usage.
